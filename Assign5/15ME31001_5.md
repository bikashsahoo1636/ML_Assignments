## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
Preprocessed the data having different scales and standard deviations by normalizing them with the help of Average and Standard Deviation Vaules stated in the documentation for spam data. 
### Package Usage
Used C-Support Vector Classification(SVC) of Support Vector Machine under ```sklearn``` library in Python. By the help of various parameters such as ```gamma```(specifying the kernel coefficient) set to ```“auto”```, ```degree```(for the polynomial functions), ```probability```(whether to include the probability estimates) set to ```“False”``` and ```tolerance```(stopping criteria for learning) set to ```1e-3```, the accuracies for different ```C```(parameter for penalizing error) being analyzed.
Three kernel functions are being tested for Spam Classification with the parameters ```gamma```, ```probability``` and ```tolerance``` set to their default values as state above:
  - ```kernel=”linear”``` where ```degree``` is set to 1 by default.
  - ```kernel="poly"``` where ```degree``` is set to 2 by default.
  - ```kernel="rbf"``` and ```degree=3```.

### Results
Below are the extremas for the Accuracy Distribution with respect to the corresponding C values
| C value | Linear Kernel | C value | Quadratic Kernel | C Value | rbf Kernel |
